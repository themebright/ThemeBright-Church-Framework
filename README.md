# ThemeBright Framework

This framework is designed to streamline and standardize the development of WordPress church themes created by ThemeBright.

It's designed to make use of [churchthemes.com](http://churchthemes.com/)'s excellent [Church Theme Content](https://wordpress.org/plugins/church-theme-content/) plugin. Their [Church Theme Framework](https://github.com/churchthemes/church-theme-framework) also served as much of the inspiration for this framework.

An integration guide is coming soon to the [ThemeBright Knowledge Base](https://themebright.com/kb/) and this README will updated once that is available.

If you have any questions or comments, we're [all ears](https://themebright.com/contact/).
